I am an ISTQB-certified software tester who is looking to get my career started. I have acquired theoretical as well as practical skills from courses and volunteer work and I am eager to start testing full time. I have experience in manual testing and reporting bugs to developers. 

I am really passionate about testing and I love tinkering with details and try to break a system in order to reveal its errors. I ask the questions that not everyone considers e.g. “What types of files should the system accept?” “Should this field have a limit of characters allowed?” “Should the user get a warning if they try to perform this action?” etc. 

In previous jobs I have managed small teams and know the importance of good communication. My dream is to be responsible for the quality assurance in an agile development team.
